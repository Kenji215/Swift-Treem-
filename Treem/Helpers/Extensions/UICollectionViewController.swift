//  Notes:  There is a documented bug with Apple that causes the image picker to crash when
//          you use "3D" touch (force press or press and hold). It's caused by one of their
//          events trying to call a private method it doesn't have access to in their sdk.
//          This is a work around (eventually we could do something with it) which is to override those
//          properties with nothing.
